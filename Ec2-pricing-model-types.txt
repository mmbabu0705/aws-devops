Amazon EC2 Pricing Models:
---------------------------------
-> With Amazon EC2, you pay only for the compute time that you use. 
-> Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options for different use cases. 

1. Ondemand instances
2. Ec2 saving plans
3. Reserved instances
4. Spot instnaces
5. Dedicated hosts

On-Demand-Instances:
---------------------------
-> you only pay for the duration that your instance runs for. (hours, minutes, seconds etc..)
-> This can be per hour or per second, depending on the instance type and operating system you choose to run.
-> No long-term commitments or upfront payments are needed.
-> On-Demand Instances include developing and testing applications and running applications that have unpredictable usage patterns.

Pros:
-> There’s no long-term commitment for using EC2 instances.
-> AWS only charges for the actual usage hours.

Cons:
-> Most expensive option.
-> Not suitable for long-running production instances.

usecases:
-> Short-term projects or PoCs.
-> Non-production workloads.
-> Assessing unpredictable workloads.

EC2-saving-plans:
--------------------
-> Savings Plan offers low prices on EC2 usage in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage measured in dollars per hour for a one or three-year term.
-> This term commitment results in savings of up to 72% over On-Demand costs.

Pros:
-> Easy to manage in comparison to Spot and Reserved Instances
-> Can achieve a discount of up to 72%
-> Predictable expenses for long-term usage

Cons:
-> Like Reserved Instances, customers need to make a long term commitment
-> Excess usage above the hourly cap are charged at an On-Demand rate

Usecases:
-> Workloads are predictable, continuous and guaranteed to remain under a threshold.
-> For workloads running on EC2 nodes, Fargate clusters or through Lambda functions.

---------------------
Reserved Instances:
----------------------
-> These are suited for steady-state workloads.
-> It's offer you up to a 75% discount versus On-Demand pricing.
-> You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a 1-year or 3-year term.
-> Scheduled Reserved Instances for a 1-year term.

Pros:
-> There’s up to 70% discount for long term usage commitment.
-> Predictable pricing.
-> Customers are able to reserve guaranteed capacity.
-> Easier to manage compared to Spot Instances.

Cons:
-> Reduced flexibility: if you don’t have instances to apply the RI, you still have to pay the price.
-> Requires a long-term commitment.

Usecases:
-> Production applications with predictable, long-term usage.

Spot Instances:
---------------
-> It's allow you to request spare Amazon EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off of the On-Demand price. 
-> Spot Instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times.
-> Unlike Amazon EC2 Savings Plans, Spot Instances do not require contracts or a commitment to a consistent amount of compute usage. 

pros:
-> Cheapest pricing model with up to 90% off On-Demand pricing.
-> Suitable for non-production workloads, or workloads that can regenerate data or reprocess from the point of termination.

Cons:
-> Your instance can be terminated unexpectedly if there is a higher bidder, 
if On Demand resource is required, or if the instance has restraints that can’t be met. 
Without proper planning, this can leave your application down.

-> This can be complex to set up if you are just getting started with AWS.

Usecases:
-> These can be very efficient for applications with high fault tolerance, or transient workloads like CI/CD pipelines.

Dedicated hosts:
------------------
-> These are physical hosts dedicated for your use for EC2. 
-> These are usually for meeting certain compliance requirements and nobody else will share tenancy of that host.
-> Dedicated Hosts are the most expensive.
